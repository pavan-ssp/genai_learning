It's a type of artificial intelligence designed to improve the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of language models, making them more human-like and effective in tackling multi-step tasks. By breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps, LangChain enables language models to provide more transparent, interpretable, and correct answers. This technology has applications in various domains, including education, research, and decision-making.</answer></response>\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 119, 'prompt_tokens': 44, 'total_tokens': 163, 'completion_time': 0.510798198, 'prompt_time': 0.000999553, 'queue_time': 0.052504767, 'total_time': 0.511797751}, 'model_name': 'llama3-70b-8192', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_dd4ae1c591', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--a36896a8-6bd1-4ab4-bfc9-cb41952a664c-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 44, 'output_tokens': 119, 'total_tokens': 163}\n"
